Many experts believe that mild cases of scoliosis do not have a large impact upon a person s health. But is this really true? Some scientists have found that, actually, mild cases of scoliosis can limit the body s ability to exercise effectively. Sometimes, too, even a small scoliosis can cause pain or other problems. Even if the scoliosis isn t getting worse, wouldn t it be nice to have an option that could help your loved one achieve their full athletic potential, or take away some of the pain or sleeplessness they may be experiencing as a result of their scoliosis? In most cases for young people with small curves, CLEAR Scoliosis Treatment does not require as large of a commitment as it does with more severe cases. Some people with small curves have achieved the results they wanted after only a few weeks of care. Also, CLEAR Certified Doctors of Chiropractic can teach your loved one some important exercises for their spine that may be helpful in the future."
